jDNN
====

A deep learning library in java. It also provides CUDA support with jcublas and a few custom kernels. Currently, it supports a composition model with deep neural network framework.

Note: As it is mainly being develpoed to support my reasearch, it is not much documented. Though I am now planning to spend more time on that (at least on the new code).
